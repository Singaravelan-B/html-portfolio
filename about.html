            <h2>Singaravelan B</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Singaravelan B, a Web Developer currently working at TCS. With nearly 2.9 years of experience in the tech industry, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects and gain expertise in different domains.</p>
            <p>My journey in web development has been rewarding, with notable contributions to a BFSI project where I focused on retirement and life insurance applications. I played a key role in enhancing the user interface and improving overall user experience by addressing bugs and implementing necessary upgrades.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I've also worked as a QA Test Analyst, gaining insights into the importance of quality assurance in delivering reliable software solutions. During this time, I was involved in testing projects, ensuring the seamless migration of data and verifying proper functionality.</p>
            <p>Prior to my professional career, I served as the Public Relationship President in the IEI (Institution of Engineers, India) chapter during my college years. Here, I organized numerous national-level events and conferences, showcasing my leadership and organizational skills.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, including reading non-fiction books, playing chess and badminton, and exploring new destinations as a wanderlust. I'm passionate about continuous learning and thrive on challenges that push me to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
            <p>With a strong foundation in technologies such as React JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java, I'm equipped to tackle diverse projects and deliver innovative solutions. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to making meaningful contributions wherever I go.</p>
